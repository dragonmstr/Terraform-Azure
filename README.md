# Terraform-Azure
This repository will contain Terraform code for Azure -  snippets, useful bits, samples, labs and more.

##About the code in this Repository
<body>Due to the fact that some of the Terraform Projects in this Repository are unlikely to be used alone, the samples provided contain a fully functional deployment. So in some cases, items like Resource Groups, VNETs, Subnets and more are deployed to support whatever is being demonstrated. 
  
  To utilise the code you may therefore just deploy as is, and see the method in my madness - and then take any elements you require to move forward from there.
