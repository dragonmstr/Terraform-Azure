# Terraform-Azure
This repository will contain Terraform code for Azure -  snippets, useful bits, samples, labs and more.

## About the code in this Repository
Due to the fact that some of the Terraform Projects in this Repository are unlikely to be used alone, the samples provided may also contain supporting elements. So in some cases, items like Resource Groups, VNETs, Subnets and more are deployed to support whatever is being demonstrated. 
  
To utilise the code you may therefore just deploy as is and see the concept being demonstrated without needing to adapt the code or rework it etc. You can then take any elements you require to move forward from there. 

## Projects in this Repository
