# Cost Optimization Example Lab

This environment is an adjusted version of my Single Region Azure BaseLab V2 - albeit with additional resources added to demonstrate elements that will be picked up by cost management tools such as Azure Advisor and Azure Cost Management. Such resources include Public IPs that are not used, extra Disks and more.
